# js-starter with react

* I created an app, input_bar and note components
* All the basic functionalities worked

## Extra Credit

* I made my notes extra pretty
* I made my notes snap to grid of [50, 50]
* When I drag one of my notes it goes above all other notes. After it's dragged,
it remained in the front. (zIndex sorting)
* I tried to resize the notes using ResizableAndMovable, it worked but my Draggable
features got override. So I decided to not include it.
